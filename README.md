This is a simple project I created to explore how side navigations work in general. I used some framer-motion to include some animations. By the way this project is in development, it's not meant to be a complete project but rather a testing project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
